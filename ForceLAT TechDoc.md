## Technical Documentation

### Purpose
* This project has the purpose to help students,teachers or any other person to programmatically draw graphs of any kinds and
connections between them by using a friendly GUI.

### Motivation
* The main motivation behind this project is the fact that there aren’t many suitable open-source software to help
people draw graphs and have much control on what’s going on.For example,finite automata “field” almost always require you
to draw some kind of flow graph,this application will help with that.

### Goal
* The goal of this project is to make the end user able to draw custom graphs,custom connections between it’s 
nodes using the mouse and keyboard,ability to save/load progress in/from *.flat custom files and to export the resulted work as *.PNG files.

### Installation
* In order to install the application,the user must simply run the bundled installer.

### Requirements
* For the casual user,the application should come prepacked with all it’s necessary runtime needed modules and be ready
to launch and use as any other app without having to install Java on his/her machine.
* For the technical user,Java JDK 14+ is required if he/she wants to tackle with the code and add features to this opensource piece of software.
InteliJ IDEA is the IDE to go with in this case.

### Technologies used
* This project is a Java (version 14+) based one.JavaFX 11 framework was used for handling the GUI of the application.
The environment used for developing the application it’s called InteliJ IDEA Community.
